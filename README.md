* Python
* pip
* Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download

### Installation
Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Monash-FIT3170/Finding-Neno.git

Create a .env file in the root directory. Add the following to the .env file (ensure the variables match that of your PostgreSQL server): 
  ```
   DATABASE_NAME=postgres  
   DATABASE_USER=postgres  
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=password  
   DATABASE_HOST=localhost  
   DATABASE_PORT=5432  
  ``` 
Create a .env file within the src/frontend/Finding-Neno directory. Add the following to this .env file:  
  ```
  IP=your deviceâ€™s IP address 
  PORT=5000
  ``` 
Run the following command from the root directory: 
* Mac users:
  ```
  src/backend/install_dependencies_mac.sh
  ```
* Windows users:
  ```
  src/backend/install_dependencies_windows.bat
  ```
If this does not work, run the following commands instead: 
  ```
  pip3 install psycopg2
  pip3 install python-dotenv
  pip3 install pytest
  pip3 install pytest-mock
  ```
Run the following command from the root directory: 
  ```
  python3 src/backend/db/setup_db.py .env
  ```
